# jackbox-sti-rs
A complete rewrite of https://github.com/weegeeday/Jackbox-sti-script (sorta) in rust because I wanted to.

This repo should be considered as a different project from the original one, and is not affiliated with the original author.

## Usage

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/OakleyCord/jackbox-sti-rs/releases/latest)
2. Run the program once in the command line and you should see three folders be created: ``original images``, ``output``, and ``replacement images``
3. Find the directory for survive the internet image folder example: ``steam/steamapps/common/The Jackbox Party Pack 4/games/SurviveTheInternet/content/STIPhoto/``
4. Copy the contents from that directory into ``original images``
5. Fill up the ``replacement images`` folder with your own images (make sure they're jpgs!!!)
6. Run the program in the command line again
7. Once its finished you should see images in the ``output`` folder just copy the contents from here to your survive the internet image folder
8. enjoy!

Note: if you want to run it again please delete the ``output`` folder before continuing.
